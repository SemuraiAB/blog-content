Apologies for the earlier interruption. Let’s continue with our tutorial series on setting up a ‘Services’ section in WordPress using the Secure Custom Fields (SCF) plugin. We’ll proceed with concise, focused steps to ensure clarity.

Part 1: Installing the Secure Custom Fields (SCF) Plugin
	1.	Access Your WordPress Dashboard:
	•	Log in to your WordPress admin panel.
	2.	Install SCF:
	•	Navigate to Plugins > Add New.
	•	Search for “Secure Custom Fields.”
	•	Click Install Now on the SCF plugin.
	•	After installation, click Activate.

Note: Installing SCF will deactivate plugins with similar functionalities, such as Advanced Custom Fields (ACF), to prevent conflicts.  ￼

Part 2: Creating a Child Theme Based on Twenty Twenty-Five
	1.	Create a Child Theme Directory:
	•	Using your code editor (e.g., Cursor IDE or Visual Studio Code), navigate to your WordPress installation directory.
	•	Go to wp-content/themes/.
	•	Create a new folder named twentytwentyfive-child.
	2.	Create a style.css File:
	•	Inside the twentytwentyfive-child folder, create a file named style.css.
	•	Add the following content:

/*
Theme Name: Twenty Twenty-Five Child
Template: twentytwentyfive
*/


	3.	Create a functions.php File:
	•	In the same folder, create a file named functions.php.
	•	Add the following PHP code to enqueue the parent and child theme styles:

<?php
function twentytwentyfive_child_enqueue_styles() {
    wp_enqueue_style('twentytwentyfive-style', get_template_directory_uri() . '/style.css');
    wp_enqueue_style('twentytwentyfive-child-style', get_stylesheet_uri(), array('twentytwentyfive-style'));
}
add_action('wp_enqueue_scripts', 'twentytwentyfive_child_enqueue_styles');


	4.	Activate the Child Theme:
	•	In your WordPress dashboard, navigate to Appearance > Themes.
	•	Activate the Twenty Twenty-Five Child theme.

Part 3: Registering a ‘Services’ Custom Post Type (CPT)
	1.	Access SCF Post Types:
	•	In your WordPress dashboard, go to SCF > Post Types.
	2.	Add New Post Type:
	•	Click on Add New.
	•	Set the following:
	•	Post Type Key: service
	•	Plural Label: Services
	•	Singular Label: Service
	3.	Configure Settings:
	•	Under Settings, adjust as needed. Ensure Public and Has Archive are set to true to make the post type publicly accessible and archivable.
	4.	Save the Post Type:
	•	Click Save to register the new ‘Services’ post type.

By completing these steps, you’ve set up the foundation for managing your business services within WordPress. In the next parts, we’ll cover creating custom taxonomies and adding custom fields to enhance the functionality of your ‘Services’ post type.
